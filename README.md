## Introduction
Form Builder is a web application that allows users to create custom forms similar to Google Forms. Users can design forms with various question types, including short answer, email, multiple-choice, checkbox, and dropdown. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with LocalStorage used for client-side data storage.

## About the Project
Form Builder is designed to provide users with a user-friendly interface to create customizable forms. The application offers five question types - short answer, email, multiple-choice, checkbox, and dropdown - to cater to different data collection needs. Users have full flexibility to add, delete, and edit form fields, creating a seamless form-building experience.

The form creation screen allows users to build their forms by adding and arranging questions. After creating the form, users can preview the form and test its functionality by submitting a sample form. The submitted data is displayed at the bottom of the page, providing users with a visual representation of the form data.

Please note that Form Builder does not have a backend for storing form submissions; it utilizes LocalStorage for client-side data storage. The primary purpose of this application is to practice JavaScript skills and clone the UI of Google Forms. While it is not fully functional, it provides a solid foundation for further development and integration with a backend for data processing and storage.
